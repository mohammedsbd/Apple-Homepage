      "product_brief_description": "Fresh colors. Tougher glass and an IP68 water-resistance rating. A brand-new chip. Two camera lenses instead of the single lens on last year's iPhone XR, which means better photos. Night mode for low-light photo settings. Excellent battery life. Good price â€¦ for an iPhone.",
      "product_description": "Remarkably similar to last year's packaging of aluminum and liquid crystals in the iPhone XR. LCD lacks the richness and color accuracy of an OLED display. 6.1-inch diagonal display is an awkward size for smaller hands. Apple is playing catch-up with the double-lens camera.",
